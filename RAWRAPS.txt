Fast cars
You know I want you
Its not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So dont keep saying our hands are tied
You claim its not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But youre here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That youre my destiny
What if we rewrite the stars
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
Youd be the one I was meant to find
Its up to you and its up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why dont we rewrite the stars
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight
You think its easy
You think I dont want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we cant walk through
I know youre wondering why
Because were able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
Youre gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say youll be mine
Everything keeps us apart
And Im not the one you were meant to find
Its not up to you its not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
Its not impossible
Is it impossible
Say that its possible
How do we rewrite the stars
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
Its up to you and its up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why dont we rewrite the stars
Changing the world to be ours
You know I want you
Its not a secret I try to hide
But I cant have you
Were bound to break and
My hands are tied
Yeah rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting this song is dedicated to you
Okay she keep cryin she keep cryin every single night
Day and night on my mind please dont kill the vibe

Here we go again when will you learn
Love is just a headache so dont be a fool
Why are you so gullible
Havent you learn from the past
How many times should i give you advice

If you choose a lot of  now is easy to get
Its easy to be scratched if theres an itch
So think now bro
Dont be afraid if she leaves you

Will forget you after getting what they want
Use you slowly like songkeramai
So just laugh theyre not your lost
We should be the man who they cry about

Your heart has been torn so many times
Gets angry if you get scolded

And calculated promises all in your conversation

Love lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for
Or do the feeling haunt you
I know the feeling haunt you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer all the stars are closer all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer all the stars are closer all the stars are closer

Know you mean wrong keep away from me
And its all wrong get it away from me yeah

I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life for the day
For the hours and another life breathin

You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life we were runnin out of time
Love lets talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for
Or do the feeling haunt you
I know the feeling haunt you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer all the stars are closer all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer all the stars are closer all the stars are closer

And still you still you want me
Oh I always let you down
Youre shattered on the ground
But still I find you there
Next to me
And oh stupid things I do
Im far from good its true

Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
Hes comin home with his neck scratched to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched
On his breaths Jack hes a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
Its a chess match shes on his back like a jetpack
Shes kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin on to the next
Actually just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
Cause she loves danger psychopath
And you dont fuck with no mans girl even I know that
But shes devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand says their relationships hangin by a strand
So shes been on the web lately
Says maybe shell be my Gwen Stacy to spite her man
And I know shes using me to try to play him I dont care
Hi Suzanne but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night but tonight I am
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
A onenight stand turned a twonight stand
It was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and
He found out now she feels deserted and used
Cause he left so what He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that were through
Its hard to find the words Im aloof nervous and Sue
Dont want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Dont take it personal I just cant say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like holeinthewall diners
Dont have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who Im turning intos
Irreversible I preyed on you like its church at the pew
And now that I got you I dont want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do
Get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound
Cause now with her in the womb
We cant bring her in this world shoulda knew
To use protection fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My names  my names
River  river run
Call me  call me
River  well let the river run
Always the bridesmaid never The bride hey
Fuck can I say If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave Id be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate like Im slidin on ice maybe
Thats why I may have came at you sideways
I cant keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
What else can I say It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didnt really wanna abort but fuck it
Whats one more lie to tell our unborn child
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one
I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Drawing me in and you kicking me out

Saw a car crash it remind me of our first date
Then I went back got massages at that one place
Always brought friends but today I feel like doin this shit alone
Callin my dad when I wanna hear some wisdom
Callin my cab alcohol up in my system
Saw a fist fight and that shit dont even make me scared no more
Man I never been the one to be alone
All my friends are always hittin up my phone
Every day is spent with everybody never on my own
But today Im by myself and I dont even feel alone
Like to smoke cigs every time I feel the outside
Like to play chicks but get mad when they get new guys
You dont get me but I dont blame you I dont get myself
Pressin on keys got my life so sweet man
GoFundMe on your bitchs pinned tweet man
Bumpin oldies as I try to dick her down
She said give it to me now and I cant help but listen
She go Ohohohoh ohoh ohoh oh
Slippery sign all over my door
Show some attitude and bitch I wont show
Expectation high I feel like a drone
2018 I got some new goals
Not checkin my statement til I got 4 mill
Rushin all year like I commit roadkill
Killin everybody like Im in a wrong deal
Do triple checks on every move I make
Work til Im tired then sip on some latte
Only do shit if we do it my way
Everything gon depend on what I say
3 4
Aye hold up wait a second
Man my flow on lethal weapon
Hit em with the rhymin pattern
Put these rappers under pressure
This feel like Armageddon
If she witcha Ima get her
Cut you off like Jerry Heller
She gon need another fella ayy
I dont take drugs I just take naps
Find another girl to eat up like I hate snacks
Dick gon make her choke like reflux gotta relax
Man yo shit is borin and its makin me go sleep fast
And I always care bout everybody but myself
Thats the life of a Virgo never gettin mad
Thats not the Brian that we know
I just weighed my heart its about 30 kilos
I just fucked a lady and she bout 30 years old
Rappin on this instrumentals feelin like a hero
Never usin triplet flows because Im not a Migo
Only lastin longer cause Im drunk I dont think she knows
Only thing that matters that my dick is like my ego
They wishin Ima fail
These days no picnics aint no fun and games
Still motherfuckas always got a lot to say
Never got love so they spreadin all this hate oh oh
Man they always actin real tough
But I show up for a show and they just wanna leave town
People sayin that my words are colder than the winter
Its Brian not Brita so Ill never have a filter
I dont really say this that often
But theres somethin that the papers forgot
Every time I read them I know I feed them
But I know theyre painting but they cant leave a mark
Cause my friends dont read the papers
And they dont really care if were awesome or not
So every time I read them I know I feed them
But I know they wanna see me hang on the wall
You dont know me
Dont you think that I get lonely
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if Im dead you owe me
If youre lonely
Dont you think youre on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if Im dead you own me
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face but you wont
I know Im not losin
But Im losin my mind
Does anybody know what thats like
You dont know me
Dont you think that I get lonely
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if Im dead you owe me
If youre lonely
Dont you think youre on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if Im dead you own me
If Im dead you owe me
If Im dead you owe me
You owe me you owe me
You owe me you owe me
If Im dead you owe me
If Im dead you owe me
You dont know me
Dont you think that I get lonely
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if Im dead you owe me
If youre lonely
Dont you think youre on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if Im dead you owe me

Not for you but for him

How could you play me when the love I gave was real
I even took you back and you still had no chill
Boy you aint gone ever learn
Play with fire you get burned
I dont think youll understand
Until I hit you where it hurts
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine
How would you like it if I do the things you do
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
Ima ride him crazy and youll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
Ima call up Brian Ima FaceTime Ryan
Ima text Lorenzo and Ima leave you cryin
Dont get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you
All of those tears I cried
I cant count the lonely nights
Time and time again Ive tried
So when I turn into a savage boy dont ask me why
Ask me why dont ask me why yeah
Give you a taste of your own medicine
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now hes dead
Mama life had just begun
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh didnt mean to make you cry

Too late my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine bodys aching all the time
Goodbye everybody Ive got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh

I sometimes wish Id never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightning me
Galileo  Galileo Galileo Figaro magnifico

Hes just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die

When your heads been drowning underwater
And its the lightness in the air
When youre there
Chest to chest with a lover
Its holding on though the roads long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that youll thank God you did
I know where you been where you are where you goin
I know youre the reason I believe in life
Whats the day without a little night
Im just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard

But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I dont wanna cry

Look I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But Im only going to get this one chance
Somethings wrong I can feel it
Six minutes Six Minutes Six minutes Slim Shady youre on
Just a feeling Ive got Like somethings about to happen but I dont know what If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My penll go off when I halfcock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin and a killin off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nutsack
Im an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables skillaholic
This flippity dippityhippity hiphop
You dont really wanna get into a pissin match
With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that
Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad
Its actually disastrously bad for the wack
While Im masterfully constructing this masterpice
Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
Let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got
Well to be truthful the blueprints
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since
MCs get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me Im a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube hey Doc Ren
Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
To meet RunDMC and induct them
Into the motherfuckin Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of
You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
Little gaylookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy
Youre witnessin a massacre
Like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy
Oy vey that boys gay  thats all they say lookin boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day lookin boy
Hey lookin boy What you say lookin boy
I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy
Ima work for everything I have never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face lookin boy
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable
Of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planets Krypton  no Asgard Asgard
So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin
Youre rodent Im omnipotent
Let off then Im reloadin
Immediately with these bombs Im totin
And I should not be woken
Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin
But I got your mom deepthroatin
Im out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin in common poodle
Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me my honestys brutal
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin
To censor you like that one line
I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine
Put em all in a line add an AK47 a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im
Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin cornrows
You write normal Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad
Singin to a man while they played piano
Man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you
Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed
Uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin Im a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman
Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and
Im devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get em motivated
I make elevating music you make elevator music
Oh hes too mainstream
Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
Its not hiphop its pop  cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it
I dont know how to make songs like that
I dont know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
Ungh school flunky pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And Im a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you
Im drunk  so Satan take the fucking wheel
Ima sleep in the front seat
Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky
But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then
But if I cant batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then
Dont mistake him for  its a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
Dont be a retard  be a king Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God
Im trying to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Cant let this moment end
You set off a dream with me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing
Take my hand
Will you share this with me
Cause darling without you
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but itll
Never be enough
Never be enough
For me
Never never
Never never
Never for me
For me
Never enough
Never enough
Never enough
For me
For me
For me
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the nightsky
Will never be enough
Never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world but itll
Never be enough
Never be enough
For me
Never never
Never never
Never for me
For me
Never enough
Never never
Never enough
Never never
Never enough
For me
For me
For me
For me

King of the filthy king of the fallen we livin again
King of the shooters looters boosters and ghettos poppin
King of the past present future my ancestors watchin
King of the culture king of the soldiers king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom king of the ocean king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters king of the fathers king of the belated
King of the answer king of the problem king of the forsaken
King of the empathy you resent me king of remorse
King of my enemies may they father feed I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers dodgin haters broke religion
Nine faces go against em I erased em with precision
I embrace them with collision
Kings did it kings vision Black Panther King Kendrick
All hail the king
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I dont pedal backwards but I live oldfashioned
The lens that Im lookin through
Wont prescribe me the right glasses masses are now free
Ashes Im dumpin out bout to spread all cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison not because of me
Because we dont glue with the opposition we glue with peace
But stilld fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for
Are you a activist What are your city plans for
Are you a accident Are you just in the way
Your native tongue contradictin what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin Are you a king or you posin
Are you a king or you smokin bud rocks to keep you open
Because the king dont cry king dont die
King dont lie king give heart king get by king dont fall
Kingdom come when I come you know why
King king king king
I am TChalla
Menoh
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I aint no fiend
I got money on my mind I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style I be dripping with ease
Please dont send me naked pictures I dont like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker well girl just let me see
I aint worried bout shit these niggas aint scaring me
I was destined for this life this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment I aint trusting a soul
I roll up the Mary Jane no they cant feel my pain
Im still trapping everyday I think Im stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I dont care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now Im up they love to hate me thats just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon fuck me like a porn star a rock star
Trying to skirt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider never put the car in park
Im shining bright just like a light cause I came from the dark
I aint never had nobody put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body come ride on my Johnny
Imma go show you the wave just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe dont lay in your grave
I aint never taking time off Im steady grinding
Im never lying was never crying
Take flights Im flying no you cant see me
Say you need me but you deceive me
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I aint no fiend
I got money on my mind I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style I be dripping with ease
Please dont send me naked pictures I dont like to be teased
Say she got that super soaker well girl just let me see
I aint worried bout shit these niggas aint scaring me
I was destined for this life this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment I aint trusting a soul
I aint never forgotten not a soul worth remembering
Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I dont talk I work hard
Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said Ill never be shit but a god damn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor
Well she aint that far off

Lovin you is like a fairytale
I just cant pick up the phone again
This time Ill be on my own my friend
One more time Im all alone again
Sex with you is like Im dreamin and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now youre gone I cant believe it
Time I spent with you deceivin me
I dont care if you believe in me
I still wonder why youre leavin me
I dont care if you believe me
I still wonder why you tease me
And if Im takin this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever youre thinkin
Its when you put me in the spotlight
I hope you know Im faded all of this liquor Im drinkin
And if Im takin this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever youre thinkin
Its when you put me in the spotlight
Its when you put me in the spotlight
When the moon hit your skin I could see you and him
Not you and me yeah but its just you and me yeah
When the sun shines above you wake up with the one you love
Not you and me yeah but its just you and me yeah
Sex with you is like Im dreamin and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now youre gone I cant believe it
Time I spent with you deceivin me
I dont care if you believe in me
I still wonder why youre leavin me
I dont care if you believe me

Right here right now
I put the offer out
I dont want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if its crazy live a little crazy
You can play it sensible a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see
Dont you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
Itll take you to the other side
Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage or youll finally take the key
Oh damn Suddenly youre free to fly
Itll take you to the other side
Okay my friend you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you but it just wont happen
So thanks but no
I think Im good to go
Cause I quite enjoy the life you say Im trapped in
Now I admire you and that whole show you do
Youre onto something really its something
But I live among the swells and we dont pick up peanut shells
Ill have to leave that up to you
Dont you know that Im okay with this uptown part I get to play
Cause I got what I need and I dont want to take the ride
I dont need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
Im good to do like me
Aint in a cage so I dont need to take the key
Oh damn Cant you see Im doing fine
I dont need to see the other side
Now is this really how you like to spend your days
Whiskey and misery and parties and plays
If I were mixed up with you Id be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned another one of the clowns
But you would finally live a little finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and itll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start em breaking
Now thats a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess Ill leave that up to you
Well its intriguing but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking
Fair enough youd want a piece of all the action
Id give you seven we could shake and make it happen
I wasnt born this morning eighteen would be just fine
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime
Fifteen
Id do eight
Twelve
Maybe nine
Ten
Dont you wanna get away to a whole new part youre gonna play
Cause I got what you need so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage cause we know how to make the key
Oh damn Suddenly were free to fly
Were going to the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Cause if we do were going to the other side
Were going to the other side
You aint cherish shit when you had it
Turn me back to a savage
Grab your stuff while you at it
Now my heart as cold as my Patek uh
Man I guess youve been away now
See me on the way up you on your way down
You had you a ten but now you a dub
You aint here but you wishing you was
You gon miss grabbing this ass
Now you can miss me with them subs
You dont gotta check on me cause I got a check on me
I dont need nothing from nobody not you especially
And you know that Im the baddest Cartier glasses Fendi fabric
And Im years away from basic and Im miles away from average
But one thing aint adding up to me
How you gon mess with a bitch that look up to me off
I cannot let up
Hungry like a Gucci sweater
Aint nobody drippin wetter
I took the time to write a letter
We worked hard out the ghetto
I dont deserve your heart know you fed up
We both had a broken heart when we met up
Your body a piece of art you dont sell it
You know that I miss it I just wanna kiss it
I scroll through the phone lookin how we would kick it
Knock at the door its a visit
She take that shit off then I fuck in the kitchen
His and hers Mr and Mrs
When I talk to her baby girl listens
I had a dream and you was in it
When you gone I feel like I been sinnin
Come back come back come back
You not really rich got the bomb pack
Dive in the water have fun with that
I might put a daughter or son in that
I bought you a ring and five hundred racks
She like the triangle Balenci bag
You know you an angel come save the bad
If you really love me then take me back
Oooh I fall apart
Oooh yeah mmhmm yeah
She told me that Im not enough
And she left me with a broken heart
She fooled me twice and its all my fault
She cut too deep now she left me scarred
Now theres too many thoughts goin through my brain
And now Im takin these shots like its Novocaine yeah
Oooh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh didnt know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty I thought
Never caught a feelin this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you dont want me no more
But I cant let go
Everybody told me so
Feelin like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it
No you said it
No you said that shit
Wed be together oh
Oooh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh didnt know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty I thought
Ice keep pourin and the drink keep flowin
Try to brush it off but it keep on goin
Covered in scars and I cant help showin
Whippin in the foreign and the tears keep blowin
Ice keep droppin and the drink keep flowin
Try to brush it off but it keep on goin
All these scars cant help from showin
Whippin in the foreign and the tears keep blowin yeah
Oooh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh didnt know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty I thought
Ayy ayy you should
Ayy ayy ayy uh you should ayy
I wrote about memories
On how I found you
About what made it easy
Giving you my heart
A million songs wont be enough
To tell the story about your beauty
This poem will extremely long
To tell about this love
This love runs out already
No longer left for the world
Because I have spent the rest of my love
Only for you
I ever thought about
How my life would be without you
Could it be more beautiful
Then I had lived until now
I always dream about
How fine the old days with you
Your long hair still remains beautiful
Although it wont stay black
If the time runs out already
No longer rests to the world
I have spent the rest of my life
Just for you
If this love runs out already
No longer left to the world
Because I have spent the rest of my love
Only for you
For you
My life and my death
When the seasons changed
Until the time stops
Even though the world hates
I will stay right here
When the time runs out already
No longer rests on the world
Because I have spent the rest of my love
Only for you
This love runs out already
No longer left for the world
Because I have spent the rest of my love
Only for you
Because I have spent the rest of my love
Only for you
There goes my heart beating
Cause you are the reason
Im losing my sleep
Please come back now
And there goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That Im still breathing
Im hopeless now
Id climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what Ive broken
Oh cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
There goes my hands shaking
And you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
I need you now
If I could turn back the clock
Id make sure the light defeated the dark
Id spend every hour of every day
Keeping you safe
Id climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what Ive broken
Oh cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
I dont want to fight no more
I dont want to hide no more
I dont want to cry no more come back I need you to hold me
A little closer now just a little closer now
Come a little closer I need you to hold me tonight
You are the reason
Id climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what Ive broken
Cause I need you to see
That you are the reason
Im a dreamer a make believer
I was told that you were too
I love the silence and the clear horizon
And I got that all from you
Every now and then Im drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face
And every little thought will lead me right back to you
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
Cause you let me walk this road alone
My childhood hero will always be you
And no one else comes close
I thought youd lead me when lifes misleading
Thats when I miss you most
Every now and then Im drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face
And every little thought will lead me right back to you
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
Cause you let me walk this road alone
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
Cause you let me walk this road alone
Cross my heart hope to die
To my lover Id never lie
He said be true I swear Ill try
In the end its him and I
Hes out his head Im out my mind
We got that love the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end its him and I him and I
My 65 speeding up the PCH a hell of a ride
They dont wanna see us make it they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldnt see the point of living on if one of us died yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating she would try to cut my
Crazy but I love her I could never run from her
Hit it no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad she be so stubborn
But what the fuck is love with no pain no suffer
Intense this shit it gets dense
She knows when Im out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
Shed be down for whatever never gotta convince
Cross my heart hope to die
To my lover Id never lie
He said be true I swear Ill try
In the end its him and I
Hes out his head Im out my mind
We got that love the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end its him and I
Him and I
Woahohohohoh
Woahohohohoh
In the end its him and I
Him and I
Woahohohohoh
Woahohohohoh
In the end its him and I
We turn up mobbin til the end of time
Only one who gets me Im a crazy fuckin Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I

Mhmm yeah alright
Ooh
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still I dont go there
Everybody says say something that says something
Say something that says something
Say something that says something
I dont wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere theres melody and harmony
For you and me tonight
I hear them call my name
Everybody says say something
Say something say something
Say something say something
Say something
I dont want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I cant get help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Maybe Im looking something I cant have
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

Moon river wider than a mile

Two drifters off to see the world
Theres such a crazy world to see
Were all chasin after all the same
Chasin after our rainbows end
Moon river wider than a mile
Crossin in style someday
My dream maker heartbreaker
Wherever youre goin Im goin the same
Two drifters off to see the world
Its such a crazy world youll see
What I see who I become
What I see who I become
Were all chasin after our end
Chasin after our ends
Lifes just around the bend my friend
Moon river and me
Feels like were on the edge right now
I wish that I could say Im proud
Im sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
Im sorry that I let you down
Lelelet you down
Yeah I guess Im a disappointment doin everything I can
I dont wanna make you disappointed its annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do was never tryna make an issue for you
But I guess the more you thought about everything you were never even wrong in the first place right
Yeah Ima just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down lookin at the ground Im embarrassed for you
Paranoia what did I do wrong this time
Thats parents for you
Very loyal
Shoulda had my back but you put a knife in itmy hands are full
What else should I carry for you
I cared for you but
Feels like were on the edge right now
I wish that I could say Im proud
Im sorry that I let you down
Lelelet you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
Im sorry that I let you down
Lelelet you down
Yeah you dont wanna make this work you just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you but you dont ever hear my words you dont wanna know my hurt yet
Let me guess you want an apology probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this
We cant so I guess Ima have to leave
Please dont come after me I just wanna be alone right now I dont really wanna think at all
Go ahead just drink it off both know youre gonna call tomorrow like nothings wrong
Aint that what you always do
I feel like every time I talk to you youre in an awful mood
What else can I offer you
Theres nothing left right now I gave it all to you
Feels like were on the edge right now

All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
Im sorry that I let you down
Lelelet you down
Yeah dont talk down to me thats not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out I dont even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch I feel like you lecture me eventually
I bet that we could have made this work and probably woulda figured things out
But I guess Im a letdown but its cool I checked out oh you wanna be friends now
Okay lets put my fake face on and pretend now sit around and talk about the good times that didnt even happen
I mean why are you laughing
Must have missed that joke let me see if I can find a reactionno but at least youre happy
Feels like were on the edge right now
I wish that I could say Im proud

All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
Im sorry that I let you down
