when everyone tells us what we can be
how can we rewrite the stars
say that the world can be ours
tonight
all i want is to fly with you
all i want is to fall with you
so just give me all of you
it feels impossible
its not impossible
is it impossible
say that its possible
how do we rewrite the stars
say you were made to be mine
nothing can keep us apart
cause you are the one i was meant to find
its up to you and its up to me
no one can say what we get to be
and why dont we rewrite the stars
changing the world to be ours

look i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
but im only going to get this one chance
somethings wrong i can feel it
six minutes six minutes six minutes slim shady youre on
just a feeling ive got like somethings about to happen but i dont know what if that means what i think it means were in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say im not taking any chances
you are just what the doc ordered
im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot
but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my penll go off when i halfcock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin and a killin off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin on his nutsack
im an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skillaholic
this flippity dippityhippity hiphop
you dont really wanna get into a pissin match
with this rappity brat packin a mac in the back of the ac
backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicin that
ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad
its actually disastrously bad for the wack
while im masterfully constructing this masterpice
cause im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard
everybody want the key and the secret
to rap immortality like i have got
well to be truthful the blueprints
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since
mcs get taken to school with this music
cause i use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
me im a product of rakim
lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey doc ren
yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
to meet rundmc and induct them
into the motherfuckin rock and roll hall of fame
even though ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of
you fags think its all a game til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
little gaylookin boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy
youre witnessin a massacre
like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy
oy vey that boys gay  thats all they say lookin boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day lookin boy
hey lookin boy what you say lookin boy
i get a hell yeah from dre lookin boy
ima work for everything i have never ask nobody for shit
get outta my face lookin boy
basically boy youre never gonna be capable
of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause
im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
the way im racin around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod
this planets krypton  no asgard asgard
so youll be thor and ill be odin
youre rodent im omnipotent
let off then im reloadin
immediately with these bombs im totin
and i should not be woken
im the walkin dead but im just a talkin head a zombie floatin
but i got your mom deepthroatin
im out my ramen noodle
we have nothin in common poodle
im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
its me my honestys brutal
but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin
to censor you like that one line
i said on im back from the mathers lp 1 when i
tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine
put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9
see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im
morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
youre pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad
singin to a man while they played piano
man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day hey fab ima kill you
lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed
uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin im a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman
innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and
im devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating
cause i know the way to get em motivated
i make elevating music you make elevator music
oh hes too mainstream
well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
its not hiphop its pop  cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make em lose it
i dont know how to make songs like that
i dont know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while im rippin any one of these verses that versus you
its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
ungh school flunky pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and im a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you
im drunk  so satan take the fucking wheel
ima sleep in the front seat
bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky
but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then
but if i cant batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
dont mistake him for  its a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
dont be a retard  be a king think not
why be a king when you can be a god
im trying to hold my breath
let it stay this way
cant let this moment end
you set off a dream with me
getting louder now
can you hear it echoing
take my hand
will you share this with me
cause darling without you
all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the nightsky
will never be enough

towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world but itll
never be enough
never be enough
for me
never never

never for me
for me
never enough

for me
for me
for me
all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the nightsky
will never be enough

towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world but itll
never be enough

for me

right here right now
i put the offer out
i dont want to chase you down
i know you see it
you run with me
and i can cut you free
out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
so trade that typical for something colorful
and if its crazy live a little crazy
you can play it sensible a king of conventional
or you can risk it all and see
dont you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
cause i got what you need
so come with me and take the ride
itll take you to the other side
cause you can do like you do
or you can do like me
stay in the cage or youll finally take the key
oh damn suddenly youre free to fly
itll take you to the other side
okay my friend you want to cut me in
well i hate to tell you but it just wont happen
so thanks but no
i think im good to go
cause i quite enjoy the life you say im trapped in
now i admire you and that whole show you do
youre onto something really its something
but i live among the swells and we dont pick up peanut shells
ill have to leave that up to you
dont you know that im okay with this uptown part i get to play
cause i got what i need and i dont want to take the ride
i dont need to see the other side
so go and do like you do
im good to do like me
aint in a cage so i dont need to take the key
oh damn cant you see im doing fine
i dont need to see the other side
now is this really how you like to spend your days
whiskey and misery and parties and plays
if i were mixed up with you id be the talk of the town
disgraced and disowned another one of the clowns
but you would finally live a little finally laugh a little
just let me give you the freedom to dream and itll
wake you up and cure your aching
take your walls and start em breaking
now thats a deal that seems worth taking
but i guess ill leave that up to you
well its intriguing but to go would cost me greatly
so what percentage of the show would i be taking
fair enough youd want a piece of all the action
id give you seven we could shake and make it happen
i wasnt born this morning eighteen would be just fine
why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime
fifteen
id do eight
twelve
maybe nine
ten
dont you wanna get away to a whole new part youre gonna play
cause i got what you need so come with me and take the ride
to the other side
so if you do like i do
so if you do like me
forget the cage cause we know how to make the key
oh damn suddenly were free to fly
were going to the other side
so if you do like i do
so if you do like me
cause if we do were going to the other side
were going to the other side
you aint cherish shit when you had it
turn me back to a savage
grab your stuff while you at it

only for you
i ever thought about
how my life would be without you

how fine the old days with you
your long hair still remains beautiful
although it wont stay black
if the time runs out already
no longer rests to the world
i have spent the rest of my life
just for you
if this love runs out already
no longer left to the world
because i have spent the rest of my love
only for you
for you
my life and my death
when the seasons changed
until the time stops
even though the world hates
i will stay right here
when the time runs out already
no longer rests on the world
because i have spent the rest of my love
only for you
this love runs out already
no longer left for the world
because i have spent the rest of my love
only for you

everyone knows all about my direction
and in my heart somewhere i wanna go there
still i dont go there
everybody says say something that says something
say something that says something
say something that says something
i dont wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
but i cant help myself no i cant help myself no no
caught up in the middle of it
no i cant help myself no i cant help myself no no no
caught up in the rhythm of it
maybe im looking something i cant have
maybe im looking something i cant have
everyone knows all about my transgressions
still in my heart somewhere theres melody and harmony
for you and me tonight
i hear them call my name
everybody says say something
say something say something
say something say something
say something
i dont want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
but i cant get help myself no i cant help myself no no
caught up in the middle of it
no i cant help myself no i cant help myself no no no
caught up in the rhythm of it
maybe im looking something i cant have
maybe im looking something i cant have
maybe im looking something i cant have
maybe im looking something i cant have
sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
but i cant help myself no i cant help myself no no
caught up in the middle of it
no i cant help myself no i cant help myself no no no
caught up in the rhythm of it
maybe im looking something i cant have
maybe im looking something i cant have
maybe im looking something i cant have
sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
